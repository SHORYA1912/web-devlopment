<p><b>Pizza[a][1] is an Italian dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomato,
cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]

Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants,
including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In
Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In
casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in
grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked
using a home oven.

In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[12]
Overall, 13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[13]</b></p>
