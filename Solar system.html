<h1><header>Formation and evolution</header></h1>

<h4>The Solar System formed at least 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large
molecular cloud.[b] This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars.[14] As
is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier
elements fused by previous generations of stars.[15]

As the pre-solar nebula[15] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The center, where
most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surroundings.[14] As the contracting nebula spun faster,
it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU[14][16] and a hot, dense protostar at
the center.[17][18] The planets formed by accretion from this disc,[19] in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted
each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System,
but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor
bodies.[20][21]

Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System
close to the Sun (within the frost line). They eventually formed the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.
Because these refractory materials only comprised a small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could
not grow very large.[20]

The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that
formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets,
allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant
elements.[20] Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt,
and Oort cloud.[20]

Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it
to begin thermonuclear fusion.[22] As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing brighter;[23] early in its
main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.[24] The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and
density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of
gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star.[25] Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and
swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space.[23]

Following the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk, the Nice model proposes that gravitational encounters between
planetisimals and the gas giants caused each to migrate into different orbits. This led to dynamical instability of the
entire system, which scattered the planetisimals and ultimately placed the gas giants in their current positions. During
this period, the grand tack hypothesis suggests that a final inward migration of Jupiter dispersed much of the asteroid
belt, leading to the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner planets.[26][27]

Present and future
The Solar System remains in a relatively stable, slowly evolving state by following isolated, gravitationally bound
orbits around the Sun.[28] Although the Solar System has been fairly stable for billions of years, it is technically
chaotic, and may eventually be disrupted. There is a small chance that another star will pass through the Solar System
in the next few billion years. Although this could destabilize the system and eventually lead millions of years later to
expulsion of planets, collisions of planets, or planets hitting the Sun, it would most likely leave the Solar System
much as it is today.[29]


The current Sun compared to its peak size in the red-giant phase
The Sun's main-sequence phase, from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around
two billion years for all other subsequent phases of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined.[30] The Solar System will
remain roughly as it is known today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium,
which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At that time,
the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the
energy output will be greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current
diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be
cooler (2,600 K (4,220 °F) at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence.[30]

The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus, and render Earth and Mars uninhabitable (possibly
destroying Earth as well).[31][32] Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium
for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of
heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will be ejected into space, leaving
behind a dense white dwarf, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth.[30] The ejected outer layers
may form a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements
like carbon—to the interstellar medium.[33][34]</h4>

<h4>Astronomers sometimes divide the Solar System structure into separate regions. The inner Solar System includes Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, and the bodies in the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune, and the bodies in the Kuiper belt.[35] Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt, the outermost parts of the Solar
System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune.[36]

Composition
Further information: List of Solar System objects and List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules
The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's
known mass and dominates it gravitationally.[37] The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for
99% of the remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar
System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less
than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.[h]

The Sun is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and helium,[41] as are Jupiter and Saturn.[42][43] A composition gradient
exists in the Solar System, created by heat and light pressure from the early Sun; those objects closer to the Sun,
which are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. Objects farther
from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points.[44] The boundary in the Solar System beyond
which those volatile substances could coalesce is known as the frost line, and it lies at roughly five times the Earth's
distance from the Sun.[5]

Orbits

Animations of the Solar System's outer planets orbiting. This animation is 100 times faster than the inner planet
animation.
The planets and other large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic.
Smaller icy objects such as comets frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane.[45][46] Most of the
planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being orbited by natural satellites called moons. All
of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face permanently turned toward their parent. The
four giant planets have planetary rings, thin discs of tiny particles that orbit them in unison.[47]

As a result of the formation of the Solar System, planets and most other objects orbit the Sun in the same direction
that the Sun is rotating. That is, counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole.[48] There are exceptions,
such as Halley's Comet.[49] Most of the larger moons orbit their planets in prograde direction, matching the direction
of planetary rotation; Neptune's moon Triton is the largest to orbit in the opposite, retrograde manner.[50] Most larger
objects rotate around their own axes in the prograde direction relative to their orbit, though the rotation of Venus is
retrograde.[51]

To a good first approximation, Kepler's laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of objects around the
Sun.[52]: 433–437  These laws stipulate that each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus, which
causes the body's distance from the Sun to vary over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is
called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion.[53]: 9-6  With the exception
of Mercury, the orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow
highly elliptical orbits. Kepler's laws only account for the influence of the Sun's gravity upon an orbiting body, not
the gravitational pulls of different bodies upon each other. On a human time scale, these perturbations can be accounted
for using numerical models,[53]: 9-6  but the planetary system can change chaotically over billions of years.[54]

The angular momentum of the Solar System is a measure of the total amount of orbital and rotational momentum possessed
by all its moving components.[55] Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it accounts for only about 2% of the
angular momentum.[56][57] The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to
the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from
comets.[56]

Distances and scales

To-scale diagram of distance between planets, with the white bar showing orbital variations. The size of the planets is
not to scale.

Orbital distances of the astronomical objects of the solar system arranged in a line that folds to fit in a rectangle.
The radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km; 400,000 mi).[58] Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (1 part in 107) of the
volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is roughly 1 millionth (10−6) that of
the Sun. Jupiter, the largest planet, is 5.2 AU from the Sun and has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU; 44,000 mi),
whereas the most distant planet, Neptune, is 30 AU from the Sun.[43][59]

With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit and the
orbit of the next nearest object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than
Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to
determine a relationship between these orbital distances, like the Titius–Bode law[60] and Johannes Kepler's model based
on the Platonic solids,[61] but ongoing discoveries have invalidated these hypotheses.[62]

Some Solar System models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the Solar System in human terms. Some are
small in scale (and may be mechanical—called orreries)—whereas others extend across cities or regional areas.[63] The
largest such scale model, the Sweden Solar System, uses the 110-meter (361-foot) Avicii Arena in Stockholm as its
substitute Sun, and, following the scale, Jupiter is a 7.5-meter (25-foot) sphere at Stockholm Arlanda Airport, 40 km
(25 mi) away, whereas the farthest current object, Sedna, is a 10 cm (4 in) sphere in Luleå, 912 km (567 mi)
away.[64][65] At that scale, the distance to Proxima Centauri would be roughly 8 times further than the Moon is from
Earth.

If the Sun–Neptune distance is scaled to 100 metres (330 ft), then the Sun would be about 3 cm (1.2 in) in diameter
(roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3 mm (0.12 in), and
Earth's diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea (0.3 mm or 0.012 in) at
this scale.[66]

Habitability
Main article: Planetary habitability in the Solar System

Comparison of the habitable zones of the Solar System and TRAPPIST-1, an ultracool red dwarf star known to have seven
terrestrial planets in stable orbits around the star.

Comparison of the habitable zones for different stellar temperatures, with a sample of known exoplanets plus the Earth,
Mars, and Venus. From top to bottom are an F-type main-sequence star, a yellow dwarf (G-type main-sequence star), an
orange dwarf (K-type main-sequence star), a typical red dwarf, and an ultra-cool dwarf.
Besides solar energy, the primary characteristic of the Solar System enabling the presence of life is the heliosphere
and planetary magnetic fields (for those planets that have them). These magnetic fields partially shield the Solar
System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium
and the strength of the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in
the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.[67]

The zone of habitability of the Solar System is conventionally located in the inner Solar System, where planetary
surface or atmospheric temperatures admit the possibility of liquid water.[68] Habitability might be possible in
subsurface oceans of various outer Solar System moons.[69]

Comparison with extrasolar systems
Compared to many extrasolar systems, the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of
Mercury.[70][71] The known Solar System lacks super-Earths, planets between one and ten times as massive as the
Earth,[70] although the hypothetical Planet Nine, if it does exist, could be a super-Earth orbiting in the edge of the
Solar System.[72]

Uncommonly, it has only small terrestrial and large gas giants; elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typical—both
rocky and gas—so there is no "gap" as seen between the size of Earth and of Neptune (with a radius 3.8 times as large).
As many of these super-Earths are closer to their respective stars than Mercury is to the Sun, a hypothesis has arisen
that all planetary systems start with many close-in planets, and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes
consolidation of mass into few larger planets, but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction
and ejection.[70][73]

The orbits of Solar System planets are nearly circular. Compared to many other systems, they have smaller orbital
eccentricity.[70] Although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial-velocity detection method
and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets, the exact causes remain undetermined.[70][74]</h4>

<h1><header>Sun</header></h1>

<h4>The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),[75]
which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System,[76] produces temperatures and densities in its core high
enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium.[77] This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly
radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.[78][79]

Because the Sun fuses hydrogen at its core, it is a main-sequence star. More specifically, it is a G2-type main-sequence
star, where the type designation refers to its effective temperature. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous but
shorter lived. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars.
Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs,
make up about 75% of the fusor stars in the Milky Way.[80]

The Sun is a population I star, having formed in the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy. It has a higher abundance of
elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance) than the older population II stars in the
galactic bulge and halo.[81] Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding
stars, so the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with these atoms. The oldest
stars contain few metals, whereas stars born later have more. This higher metallicity is thought to have been crucial to
the Sun's development of a planetary system because the planets formed from the accretion of "metals".[82]

The region of space dominated by the Solar magnetosphere is the heliosphere, which spans much of the Solar System. Along
with light, the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles (a plasma) called the solar wind. This stream
spreads outwards at speeds from 900,000 kilometres per hour (560,000 mph) to 2,880,000 kilometres per hour (1,790,000
mph),[83] filling the vacuum between the bodies of the Solar System. The result is a thin, dusty atmosphere, called the
interplanetary medium, which extends to at least 100 AU.[84]

Activity on the Sun's surface, such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections, disturbs the heliosphere, creating space
weather and causing geomagnetic storms.[85] Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge
quantities of material from the surface of the Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's
magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near
the magnetic poles.[86] The largest stable structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet, a spiral
form created by the actions of the Sun's rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium.[87][88]

Inner Solar System</h4>

<h1><header>Inner planets</header></h1>

<h4>The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. They are
composed largely of refractory minerals such as silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals such as iron
and nickel which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth, and Mars) have atmospheres substantial
enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and
volcanoes.[91]

Mercury (0.31–0.59 AU from the Sun)[D 6] is the smallest planet in the Solar System. Its surface is grayish, with an
expansive rupes (cliff) system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants.[92]
The surface has widely varying temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420
°C (790 °F) during sunlight. In the past, Mercury was volcanically active, producing smooth basaltic plains similar to
the Moon.[93] It is likely that Mercury has a silicate crust and a large iron core.[94][95] Mercury has a very tenuous
atmosphere, consisting of solar-wind particles and ejected atoms.[96] Mercury has no natural satellites.[97]
Venus (0.72–0.73 AU)[D 6] has a reflective, whitish atmosphere that is mainly composed of carbon dioxide. At the
surface, the atmospheric pressure is ninety times as dense as on Earth's sea level.[98] Venus has a surface temperatures
over 400 °C (752 °F), mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.[99] The planet lacks a protective
magnetic field to protect against stripping by the solar wind, which suggests that its atmosphere is sustained by
volcanic activity.[100] Its surface displays extensive evidence of volcanic activity with stagnant lid tectonics.[101]
Venus has no natural satellites.[97]
Earth (0.98–1.02 AU)[D 6] is the only place in the universe where life and surface liquid water are known to exist.[102]
Earth's atmosphere contains 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, which is the result of the presence of life.[103][104] The
planet has a complex climate and weather system, with conditions differing drastically between climate regions.[105] The
solid surface of Earth is dominated by green vegetation, deserts and white ice sheets.[106][107][108] Earth's surface is
shaped by plate tectonics that formed the continental masses.[93] Earth's planetary magnetosphere shields the surface
from radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining life habitability.[109]
The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.[110] Its diameter is one-quarter the size of Earth's.[111] Its surface is
covered in very fine regolith and dominated by impact craters.[112][113] Large dark patches on the Moon, maria, are
formed from past volcanic activity.[114] The Moon's atmosphere is extremely thin, consisting of a partial vacuum with
particle densities of under 107 per cm−3.[115]
Mars (1.38–1.67 AU)[D 6] has a radius about half of that of Earth.[116] Most of the planet is red due to iron oxide in
Martian soil,[117] and the polar regions are covered in white ice caps made of water and carbon dioxide.[118] Mars has
an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with surface pressure 0.6% of that of Earth, which is sufficient to
support some weather phenomena.[119] During the Mars year (687 Earth days), there are large surface temperature swings
on the surface between −78.5 °C (−109.3 °F) to 5.7 °C (42.3 °F). The surface is peppered with volcanoes and rift
valleys, and has a rich collection of minerals.[120][121] Mars has a highly differentiated internal structure, and lost
its magnetosphere 4 billion years ago.[122][123] Mars has two tiny moons:[124]
Phobos is Mars's inner moon. It is a small, irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of 11 km (7 mi). Its surface is
very unreflective and dominated by impact craters.[D 7][125] In particular, Phobos's surface has a very large Stickney
impact crater that is roughly 4.5 km (2.8 mi) in radius.[126]
Deimos is Mars's outer moon. Like Phobos, it is irregularly shaped, with a mean radius of 6 km (4 mi) and its surface
reflects little light.[D 8][D 9] However, the surface of Deimos is noticeably smoother than Phobos because the regolith
partially covers the impact craters.[127]</h4>

<h1><header>Asteroids and Asteroid belt </header></h1>

<h4>Asteroids except for the largest, Ceres, are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of
carbonaceous, refractory rocky and metallic minerals, with some ice.[128][129] They range from a few meters to hundreds
of kilometers in size. Many asteroids are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital
characteristics. Some asteroids have natural satellites that orbit them, that is, asteroids that orbit larger
asteroids.[130]

Mercury-crossing asteroids are those with perihelia within the orbit of Mercury. At least 362 are known to date, and
include the closest objects to the Sun known in the Solar System.[131] No vulcanoids, asteroids between the orbit of
Mercury and the Sun, have been discovered.[132][133] As of 2024, one asteroid has been discovered to orbit completely
within Venus's orbit, 594913 ꞌAylóꞌchaxnim.[134]
Venus-crossing asteroids are those that cross the orbit of Venus. There are 2,809 as of 2015.[135]
Near-Earth asteroids have orbits that approach relatively close to Earth's orbit,[136] and some of them are potentially
hazardous objects because they might collide with Earth in the future.[137][138] There are over 37.000 known as of
2024.[139] A number of solar-orbiting meteoroids were large enough to be tracked in space before striking Earth. It is
now widely accepted that collisions in the past have had a significant role in shaping the geological and biological
history of Earth.[140]
Mars-crossing asteroids are those with perhihelia above 1.3 AU which cross the orbit of Mars.[141] As of 2024, NASA
lists 26,182 confirmed Mars-crossing asteroids.[135]
Asteroid belt
The asteroid belt occupies a torus-shaped region between 2.3 and 3.3 AU from the Sun, which lies between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter. It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the
gravitational interference of Jupiter.[142] The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects
over one kilometer in diameter.[143] Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a
thousandth of that of Earth.[40] The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass through without
incident.[144]


The four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea. Only Ceres and Vesta have been visited by a spacecraft and
thus have a detailed picture.
Below are the descriptions of the three largest bodies in the asteroid belt. They are all considered to be relatively
intact protoplanets, a precursor stage before becoming a fully-formed planet (see List of exceptional
asteroids):[145][146][147]

Ceres (2.55–2.98 AU) is the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt.[148] It is the largest object in the belt, with a
diameter of 940 km (580 mi).[149] Its surface contains a mixture of carbon,[150] frozen water and hydrated
minerals.[151] There are signs of past cryovolcanic activity, where volatile material such as water are erupted onto the
surface, as seen in surface bright spots.[152] Ceres has a very thin water vapor atmosphere, but practically speaking it
is indistinguishable from a vacuum.[153]
Vesta (2.13–3.41 AU) is the second-largest object in the asteroid belt.[154] Its fragments survive as the Vesta asteroid
family[155] and numerous HED meteorites found on Earth.[156] Vesta's surface, dominated by basaltic and metamorphic
material, has a denser composition than Ceres's.[157] Its surface is marked by two giant craters: Rheasilvia and
Veneneia.[158]
Pallas (2.15–2.57 AU) is the third-largest object in the asteroid belt.[154] It has its own Pallas asteroid family.[155]
Not much is known about Pallas because it has never been visited by a spacecraft,[159] though its surface is predicted
to be composed of silicates.[160]
Hilda asteroids are in a 3:2 resonance with Jupiter; that is, they go around the Sun three times for every two Jovian
orbits.[161] They lie in three linked clusters between Jupiter and the main asteroid belt.

Trojans are bodies located within another body's gravitationally stable Lagrange points: L4, 60° ahead in its orbit, or
L5, 60° behind in its orbit.[162] Every planet except Mercury and Saturn is known to possess at least 1
trojan.[163][164][165] The Jupiter trojan population is roughly equal to that of the asteroid belt.[166] After Jupiter,
Neptune possesses the most confirmed trojans, at 28.[167]</h4>

<h1><header>Outer planets</header></h1>

<h4>The four outer planets, called giant planets or Jovian planets, collectively make up 99% of the mass orbiting the
Sun.[h] All four giant planets have multiple moons and a ring system, although only Saturn's rings are easily observed
from Earth.[91] Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases with extremely low melting points, such as hydrogen,
helium, and neon,[168] hence their designation as gas giants.[169] Uranus and Neptune are ice giants,[170] meaning they
are largely composed of 'ice' in the astronomical sense (chemical compounds with melting points of up to a few hundred
kelvins[168] such as water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and carbon dioxide.[171]) Icy substances comprise the
majority of the satellites of the giant planets and small objects that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.[171][172]

Jupiter (4.95–5.46 AU)[D 6] is the biggest and most massive planet in the Solar System. On its surface, there are
orange-brown and white cloud bands moving via the principles of atmospheric circulation, with giant storms swirling on
the surface such as the Great Red Spot and white 'ovals'. Jupiter possesses a strong enough magnetosphere to redirect
ionizing radiation and cause auroras on its poles.[173] As of 2024, Jupiter has 95 confirmed satellites, which can
roughly be sorted into three groups:
The Amalthea group, consisting of Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. They orbit substantially closer to Jupiter than
other satellites.[174] Materials from these natural satellites are the source of Jupiter's faint ring.[175]
The Galilean moons, consisting of Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa. They are the largest moons of Jupiter and exhibit
planetary properties.[176]
Irregular satellites, consisting of substantially smaller natural satellites. They have more distant orbits than the
other objects.[177]
Saturn (9.08–10.12 AU)[D 6] has a distinctive visible ring system orbiting around its equator composed of small ice and
rock particles. Like Jupiter, it is mostly made of hydrogen and helium.[178] At its north and south poles, Saturn has
peculiar hexagon-shaped storms larger than the diameter of Earth. Saturn has a magnetosphere capable of producing weak
auroras. As of 2024, Saturn has 146 confirmed satellites, grouped into:
Ring moonlets and shepherds, which orbit inside or close to Saturn's rings. A moonlet can only partially clear out dust
in its orbit,[179] while the ring shepherds are able to completely clear out dust, forming visible gaps in the
rings.[180]
Inner large satellites Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, and Dione. These satellites orbit within Saturn's E ring. They are
composed mostly of water ice and are believed to have differentiated internal structures.[181]
Trojan moons Calypso and Telesto (trojans of Tethys), and Helene and Polydeuces (trojans of Dione). These small moons
share their orbits with Tethys and Dione, leading or trailing either.[182][183]
Outer large satellites Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, and Iapetus.[181] Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System to have
a substantial atmosphere.[184]
Irregular satellites, consisting of substantially smaller natural satellites. They have more distant orbits than the
other objects. Phoebe is the largest irregular satellite of Saturn.[185]
Uranus (18.3–20.1 AU),[D 6] uniquely among the planets, orbits the Sun on its side with an axial tilt >90°. This gives
the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points alternately toward and then away from the Sun.[186] Uranus'
outer layer has a muted cyan color, but underneath these clouds are many mysteries about its climate, such as unusually
low internal heat and erratic cloud formation. As of 2024, Uranus has 28 confirmed satellites, divided into three
groups:
Inner satellites, which orbit inside Uranus' ring system.[187] They are very close to each other, which suggests that
their orbits are chaotic.[188]
Large satellites, consisting of Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.[189] Most of them have roughly equal
amounts of rock and ice, except Miranda, which is made primarily of ice.[190]
Irregular satellites, having more distant and eccentric orbits than the other objects.[191]
Neptune (29.9–30.5 AU)[D 6] is the furthest planet known in the Solar System. Its outer atmosphere has a slightly muted
cyan color, with occasional storms on the surface that look like dark spots. Like Uranus, many atmospheric phenomena of
Neptune are unexplained, such as the thermosphere's abnormally high temperature or the strong tilt (47°) of its
magnetosphere. As of 2024, Neptune has 16 confirmed satellites, divided into two groups:
Regular satellites, which have circular orbits that lie near Neptune's equator.[185]
Irregular satellites, which as the name implies, have less regular orbits. One of them, Triton, is Neptune's largest
moon. It is geologically active, with erupting geysers of nitrogen gas, and possesses a thin, cloudy nitrogen
atmosphere.[192][184]
Centaurs
Main article: Centaur
The centaurs are icy, comet-like bodies whose semi-major axes are longer than Jupiter's and shorter than Neptune's
(between 5.5 and 30 AU). These are former Kuiper belt and scattered disc objects (SDOs) that were gravitationally
perturbed closer to the Sun by the outer planets, and are expected to become comets or be ejected out of the Solar
System.[39] While most centaurs are inactive and asteroid-like, some exhibit cometary activity, such as the first
centaur discovered, 2060 Chiron, which has been classified as a comet (95P) because it develops a coma just as comets do
when they approach the Sun.[193] The largest known centaur, 10199 Chariklo, has a diameter of about 250 km (160 mi) and
is one of the few minor planets possessing a ring system.[194][195]
