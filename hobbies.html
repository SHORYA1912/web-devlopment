<h1>Reading insteresting novel</h1>
</p>
<p>Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of symbols, often specifically those of a written language, by
means of sight or touch.[1][2][3][4]

For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography
(spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.[5][6]

Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on
speech-based writing systems.[7] The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual
notations or tactile signals (as in the case of braille).[8]</p>
