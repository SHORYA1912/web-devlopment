<p>Pizza</p>

<p>Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
oven.

The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish. In
2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]

Pizza and its variants are among the most popular foods in the world. Pizza is sold at a variety of restaurants,
including pizzerias (pizza specialty restaurants), Mediterranean restaurants, via delivery, and as street food.[9] In
Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[10][11] In
casual settings, however, it is typically cut into slices to be eaten while held in the hand. Pizza is also sold in
grocery stores in a variety of forms, including frozen or as kits for self-assembly. Store-bought pizzas are then cooked
using a home oven.

In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.[12]
Overall, 13% of the US population aged two years and over consumed pizza on any given day.[13]

Etymology
The oldest recorded usage of the word pizza is thought to be from May 997 CE, appearing in the Codex diplomaticus
Caietanus, a notarial Latin document from the town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire.[14] The text
states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze (lit. 'twelve pizzas'),[15] a
pork shoulder and kidney annually on Christmas Day, and twelve pizzas and a couple of chickens annually on Easter
Sunday.[16]

Suggested etymologies include:

Byzantine Greek and Late Latin pitta > pizza, cf. Modern Greek pitta bread and the Apulia and Calabrian (then Byzantine
Italy) pitta,[17] a round flat bread baked in the oven at high temperature sometimes with toppings. The word pitta can
in turn be traced to either Ancient Greek πικτή (pikte), 'fermented pastry', which in Latin became picta, or Ancient
Greek πίσσα (pissa, Attic: πίττα, pitta), 'pitch',[18][19] or πήτεα (pḗtea), 'bran' (πητίτης, pētítēs, 'bran
bread').[20]
The Etymological Dictionary of the Italian Language explains it as coming from dialectal pinza, 'clamp', as in modern
Italian pinze, 'pliers, pincers, tongs, forceps'. Their origin is from Latin pinsere, 'to pound, stamp'.[21]
The Lombardic word bizzo or pizzo, meaning 'mouthful' (related to the English words bit and bite), which was brought to
Italy in the middle of the 6th century AD by the invading Lombards.[2][22] The shift b→p could be explained by the High
German consonant shift, and it has been noted in this connection that in German the word Imbiss means 'snack'.
A small pizza is sometimes called pizzetta.[23] A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.[24]

The word pizza was borrowed from Italian into English in the 1930s; before it became well known, pizza was called
"tomato pie" by English speakers. Some regional pizza variations still use the name tomato pie.[25]</p>
