<h2><b><p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the
diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally
available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.

Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and
traditions.[1][2] Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in
introducing certain foods to India. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and
fruits. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions
of India.[3]

Indian cuisine has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between India and Europe was the
primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery.[4] Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia.
Indian cuisine has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe (Britain in particular), the
Middle East, Southern African, East Africa, Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the
Caribbean.[5][6]

World Wildlife Fund (WWF)’s Living Planet Report released on 10 October 2024 emphasized India’s food consumption pattern
as the most sustainable among the big economies (G20 countries).[7]

History
Main article: History of Indian cuisine
Indian cuisine reflects an 8,000-year history of various groups and cultures interacting with the Indian subcontinent,
leading to diversity of flavours and regional cuisines found in modern-day India. Later, trade with British and
Portuguese influence added to the already diverse Indian cuisine.[8][9]

After 9000 BCE, a first period of indirect contacts between Fertile Crescent and Indus Valley civilizations seems to
have occurred as a consequence of the Neolithic Revolution and the diffusion of agriculture. Wheat and barley were first
grown around 7000 BCE, when agriculture spread from the Fertile Crescent to the Indus Valley. Sesame and humped cattle
were domesticated in the local farming communities. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and
herding in South Asia. By 3000 BCE, turmeric, cardamom, black pepper and mustard were harvested in India.

From Around 2350 BCE the evidence for imports from the Indus to Ur in Mesopotamia have been found, as well as Clove
heads which are thought to originate from the Moluccas in Maritime Southeast Asia were found in a 2nd millennium BC site
in Terqa. Akkadian Empire records mention timber, carnelian and ivory as being imported from Meluhha by Meluhhan ships,
Meluhha being generally considered as the Mesopotamian name for the Indus Valley Civilization.</p></b></h2>
